# PyBer ride-sharing analysis by city type

**Analysis Overview:** The analysis is focused on comparing ride-sharing among different type of cities (Urban, Suburban or Rural) specifically focusing on three variables: rides, drivers and fares per city.

#### Election results

  - Arapahoe:   6.7%;   24,801 votes

  ***Percentage and total votes per candidate***

  - Charles Stockham:  23.0%;  85,213 votes
  - Raymon Doane:      3.1%;   11,606 votes

#### Looking forward with election audits

For further elections this same analysis can be used using the same code but we can add extra value to it by using other known data like the voting method summary and also specifying the election purpose; U.S. congressional / Senator / Local election)

Once we receive the voting method data we need to add three variables to the code:
- Voting method list
- Voting method dictionary
- Each method count
We need to add two for loops, first one that will list the voting methods and then another that will count each method

For the election purpose we just need to indicate in the f-string the purpose.
