# PyBer ride-sharing analysis by city type

**Analysis Overview:** The analysis is focused on comparing ride-sharing among different type of cities (Urban, Suburban or Rural) specifically focusing on three variables: rides, drivers and fares per city.

#### Analysis results

For the company it is very important to have a lot of presence on Urban cities since most of the revenue is done on that group of cities but Suburban cities are a good cluster because it is needed less drivers that generate a significant revenue so it reduces complexity. Probably the best business for a driver would be to work in a Rural area since tha fare is 3 times higher than working on an Urban city.

***Recommendations:***

- As mentioned before it is important to continue gaining revenue on Suburban areas and promoting among drivers to work on that kind of cities
- Total fares in Rural cities is slightly improving there is not a big difference on the average fare per ride but the average fare per driver is way high, it is important to promote the use of ride-sharing among that kind fo cities
- There is a need to add another variable because there is a slight tendency that revenue is not growing in Urban cities, so it is important to analyze burnout among drivers where the average fare per driver is lower so we need to analyze time working to get a good income without being burnout
